# AlgorithmDesign_SudokuProject
## SUDOKU SOLVER
In this project, your objective is to design and implement algorithms to solve the famous Sudoku problem.  
In the Sudoku problem, you are given a partially filled 9×9 2D array, and the goal is to assign digits (from 1 to 9) to the empty cells so that every row, column, and subgrid of size 3×3 contains exactly one instance of the digits from 1 to 9.

## Team members:
Ambrosetti William, Bernacchia Alessia, Baruscotti Sergio, Biddiscombe Alexandra


## Project info:
### project type:
**implementation project** consist of implementing an algorithm to solve a particular problem, preparing a short report of 3 pages, and delivering a 10-minutes presentation.
### due date and submission:
Projects must be delivered by the end of the exam session (30th January) in this link https://www.icorsi.ch/mod/assign/view.php?id=1157722. Each team must get in contact with the instructor to schedule a call/meeting for presenting their presentation.  

## Tasks: 
1. Provide a detailed description of a brute force algorithm to solve Sudoku.
2. Provide a detailed description of algorithm based on recursion along with an example to 
illustrate the working of the algorithm. 
3. A pseudo code for the brute force algorithm. 
4. A pseudo code for the recursion-based algorithm. 
5. Analyze the theoretical time-complexity of the algorithm of (3).  
6. Analyze the theoretical time-complexity of the algorithm of (4). 
7. Implement the brute force algorithm and the recursion-based algorithm. 
8. Run 50 simulations of each of the two algorithms while reporting the execution time for each case. Show the maximum, average, and minimum execution time of each of the algorithms.

## What to include in the report:  
Your response to tasks 1 through 6. For task 7, provide the code along with a clear documentation of methods used. For task 8, provide a table with results along with a description and a short discussion.  

## Presentation:  
Team presentation for this project is of 10 minutes. The presentation be structured as follows.
- **Problem statement:** what problem are you trying to solve. You can include an example as well. 
- **Objective:** what is your objective for solving this problem.
- **Proposed algorithm:** describe your proposed algorithms and their computational complexity.
- **Results and short discussion**.
